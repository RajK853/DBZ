All the image and sound files are kept in this data folder under Image and Sound folders respectively.
The link to the Data.zip is here:

(Contains only wav and png files)
Extract the Data.zip file and don't put the DBZ.py file inside the Data folder; keep them side-by-side.

If you want to open the exe version instead of .py version, then put this Data folder inside the DBZ folder (side-by-side with DBZ.exe).
Enjoy the game! :)
