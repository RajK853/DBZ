Here is the exe version of the above DBZ game.
The game link is here: http://sharesend.com/bikojblv
I am using .ogg sounds instead of .wav because they have relatively smaller size than .wav files.
Because of this, the exe program needs to have this modules too.
So extract this module in the DBZ folder.

Enjoy the game :)
