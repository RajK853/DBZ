Here is the link to the exe version of the game:

Download and extract the "DBZ (exe).zip". Then download the "Data.zip" from the here: 
http://sharesend.com/7ubgp7sf
After that extract the Data.zip and cut-paste the 'Data' folder inside the DBZ folder then run DBZ.exe.

Use this exe file on your own risk (which is minimal as I have updated KIS 2015).
If you find it's risky, use the .py version instead provided in this repository.
