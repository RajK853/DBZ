# DBZ

**Description:** This is a shooting game based on DBZ. As you destroy obstacles and score more,
you can unlock new abilites such as Kamehameha, Explosive Wave and Super Sayan mode. 
Play as a sayan and become a sayan. Let's see if you can set an unbeatable score :)

## Features:
* Easy UI
* Special moves present
* Boss-feature added

## Requirements:
* Python 3.x
* Pygame 3.x

**Note:** If you don't meet the above requirements, you can use the exe version of the game above.
If you already have an obsolete exe version of this game, you don't have to download the 
DBZ (exe version).zip again. Just download the "Dragon_Ball.py" and "Data" folder 
(may not be necessary but recommended) and copy them to the folder with the "DBZ.exe" file.
Enjoy the game and feel free to leave any feedbacks and suggestions or report any bug at
